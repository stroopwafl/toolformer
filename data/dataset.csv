Output: ","If Cera is 46.0 years old now, she was 46.0-6 = 40.0 years old six years ago. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, meaning Noah was 1/2*40.0 = 20.0 years. If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000.0 times the age of Noah, there were 3000.0*20.0 = 60000.0 people living in Chile. Since the population of Chile was half what it was now six years ago, currently Chile has 60000.0*2 = 120000.0 people. "

Output: ","Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12.0 x 7 = 84.0. So, her weekly electric bill is 84.0 x $1.5 = $126.0. Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12.0 + 2.0 = 14.0. So her weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is 14.0 x 7= 98.0 kilowatts per hour. Ada's new electric bill per week will be 98.0 x $1.5 = $147.0. Therefore, the difference between the bill before and after she adds the new device is $21.0. "

Output: ","Let Z be the ounces of zest Tanya uses. Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses Z + Z = 2Z fragrance and zest. She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2Z salt. She uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2Z + 2Z + 2Z = 6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar. She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2Z = 4Z oil. In all, she uses 6Z + 4Z = 10Z = 10 ounces of fragrance, zest, salt, sugar, and oil. Thus, she uses Z = 10.0 / 10 = 6.0 ounce of zest. Thus, Tanya uses 4Z = 46.0 ounces of oil. "
